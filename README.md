# Guacamole 1.5.3 VDI/Jump Server Appliance Build Script

<img src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/sparkles.png" width="35"> This repo makes setting up a Guacamole a breeze. Its got installer support for TLS reverse proxy, Active Directory integration, multi-factor authentication, Quick Connect & History Recording Storage UI enhancements, dark mode and custom UI templates, auto database backup, O365 email alerts and even fail2ban and internal daemon security hardening options. There's also code in here to get you up and running with an enterprise high availability deployment if that's your thing!

## Automatic Installation

<img src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/rocket.png" width="35"> To start building your Guacamole appliance, paste the below link into a terminal and just follow the prompts **(no need for sudo, but the user must be a member of the sudo group)**:

```shell
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itiligent/Guacamole-Install/main/1-setup.sh && chmod +x 1-setup.sh && ./1-setup.sh
```

## Prerequisites (Yes! Debian 12 is now supported!)

<img src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/lock.png" width="35"> **Before diving in, make sure you have:**

- **A compatible OS:**
    - **Debian 12, 11 or 10**
    - **Ubuntu 23.04, 22.04, 20.04 & 18.04**
    - **Raspbian Buster & Bullseye**
    - **Official vendor cloud images equivalent to the above.**
- Minimum 8GB RAM and 40GB HDD.
- DNS entries matching your default appliance network interface IP (essential for TLS).
- Open TCP ports: 22, 80, and 443.

## Installation Menu

<img src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/wrench.png" width="35"> **The main script guides you through the installation process in the following steps:**

1. Confirm your system hostname and local DNS domain suffix. (Must be consistent for TLS proxy)
2. Choose a locally installed or remote MySQL instance, set database security preferences.
3. Pick an authentication extension: DUO, TOTP, LDAP, or none.
4. Select optional console features: Quick Connect & History Recorded Storage UI integrations.
5. Decide on the Guacamole front end: Nginx reverse proxy (http or https) or keep the native Guacamole interface


## Managing self signed TLS certs with Nginx (the easy way!)

   - **To change the reverse proxy dns name or IP:** 
     - Just re-run ` 4a-install-tls-self-signed-nginx.sh`as many times as you like (accompanying server and browser client certs will also be updated) 
   - **To renew certificates only, or change IP only:**
     - Simply run `refresh-tls-self-signed-nginx.sh` as needed.
   - **Above scripts will also:**
     - Create and save new client browser certificates to `$HOME/guac-setup`
     - Provide on-screen instructions for client certificate import (no more pesky browser warnings and that pro look). 
   

## Active Directory Integration

<img src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/key.png" width="35"> **Need help with Active Directory authentication?** Check [here](https://github.com/itiligent/Guacamole-Install/blob/main/ACTIVE-DIRECTORY-HOW-TO.md).

## Customise & Brand Your Guacamole Theme

## Installation Instructions

<img src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2699.png" width="35"> 

### **Paste and the wget autorun link, thats it! *But if* you want to make Guacamole your own and customise...**
**Exit `1-setup.sh` at the first prompt**. All the configurable options can be found at the start of `1-setup.sh`. Certain combinations of edits will even produce an unattended install!

**Other useful install notes:**
- **Caution: Be aware that running the auto-run link again re-downloads the suite of scripts and will overwrite your changes. You must run setup locally after editing the setup script.** (Also be sure to comment out the download links in the setup script for any other scripts you want to edit, but there should be little need to touch these.)
- Many of the scripts in the suite are **automatically adjusted with your chosen installation settings** to form a matched & transportable set. This allows you to add extra features after installation whilst avoiding mismatches with the original install.
- Nginx is automatically configured to use TLS 1.2 or above (so really old browser versions may not work.)
- A daily MySQL backup job will be automatically configured under the script owner's crontab.
- **Security info:** The Quick Connect and History Recorded Storage options bring a few security implications; so be aware of potential risks in your particular environment.

**For the more security minded, there's several post-install hardening script options available:**

- `add-fail2ban.sh`: Adds a lockdown policy for Guacamole to guard against brute force attacks.
- `add-tls-guac-daemon.sh`: Wraps internal server daemon <--> guac application traffic in TLS.
- `add-auth-ldap.sh`: A template script for Active Directory integration.
- `add-smtp-relay-o365.sh`: A template script for email alerts integrated with MSO65 (BYO app password).


## Upgrading Guacamole

<img src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/globe_with_meridians.png" width="35"> To upgrade Guacamole, edit `upgrade-guac.sh` to relfect the latest versions of Guacamole and MySQL connector/J before running it. This script will also automatically update the installed extensions.

## Enterprise Scale Out & High Availability 

<img src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f454.png" width="35"> For Enterprise deployments, did you know that Guacamole can be run in a load balanced farm? To achieve this, the database, application and front end components are usually **split into 2 or 3 layers.** (VLANs & firewalls between the layers helps with security too.) See [here](https://github.com/itiligent/Guacamole-Install/tree/main/guac-enterprise-build) for how to get started.
- **For the DATABASE layer:** Find the included `install-mysql-backend-only.sh` to install a standalone instance of the Guacamole MySQL database for your backend.
- **For the APPLICATION layer:** Simply use the main setup script to build as many application servers as you like, just use the installer to point these to the backend database, making sure to **say no to both the "Install MySQL locally" option and any Nginx install options**.
- **For the Front end**: There are so many choices available that are already very well documented. You could even take the (portable) Nginx scripts to build a separate TLS front end layer. Be aware that [HA Proxy](https://www.haproxy.org/) generally provides far superior session affinity and persistence under load balanced conditions [when compared to Open Source Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/products/nginx/compare-models/) as only Nginx Plus subscribers get all the proper load balancing stuff!)
